            <li><strong>Preferences</strong> — Fitness goals, settings, and any custom preferences you set.</li>
            <li><strong>Activity</strong> — Exercises, sets, reps, weights, workout history, and progress metrics.</li>
            <li><strong>Information</strong> — Device type, app version, and performance logs that help us improve app functionality.</li>
            <li><strong>Optional Inputs</strong> — Notes, targets, or additional health/fitness data you choose to share.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Full Transparency, Always</h2>
