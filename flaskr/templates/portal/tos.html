        <h3>A. Binding Arbitration</h3>
        <article>
            <p>Any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or relating to these Terms or your use of Gymmate shall be resolved through binding arbitration rather than in court, except that you may assert claims in small claims court if your claims qualify.</p>

            <p><strong>Remote Arbitration:</strong>  You may request to participate in arbitration remotely via videoconference. If you can demonstrate financial hardship that prevents you from participating (whether remotely or in Arizona), and the arbitrator agrees, you may participate remotely at no cost to you for the videoconference technology. However, you remain responsible for your own attorneys' fees and other costs unless otherwise awarded by the arbitrator.</p>
        </article>
        <h3>C. Class Action Waiver</h3>
